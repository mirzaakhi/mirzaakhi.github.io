My responsibilities as a Teaching Assistant for the Masters program involved evaluating student activities in the area of machine learning meticulously. In particular, I assessed their understanding and application of key algorithms such as SVM, Perceptron, and Adaline, as well as their proficiency with tools such as Scikit-learn. Using rigorous feedback and objective marking, I sought to ensure that students not only understood theoretical concepts but were also able to put them into practice. I enjoyed this challenging role, which underscored the importance of providing students with a thorough assessment process in order to guide them in the right direction.

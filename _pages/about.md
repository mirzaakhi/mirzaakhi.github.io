I am a PhD researcher at [Data Driven Computer Engineering](https://www.d2ice.ie/team), University of Limerick, Ireland. My ongoing research delves into healthcare IoT security, utilizing AI/ML innovations.

I obtained an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Jagannath University, Bangladesh. A major focus of my research was Internet of Things (IoT) security and Machine Learning (ML). My academic background is in computer science. Furthermore, I received a scholarship from the Science Foundation Ireland Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science (2022). As a Master of Science student, I achieved the top position in my class. I have presented my work at a number of prestigious international conferences. My research interests span IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Network Security, and Systems Architecture.

As part of my role at university, I am a Teaching Assistant for the course on Data Engineering and Machine Learning. Outside of university, I also work as a private tutor for secondary school students in a variety of subjects including mathematics and computer programming. Additionally, I enjoy writing and making videos for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MirzaAkhi/featured).

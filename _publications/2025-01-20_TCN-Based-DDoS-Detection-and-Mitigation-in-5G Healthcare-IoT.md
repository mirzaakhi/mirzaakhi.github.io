The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes precision healthcare by enhancing patient care and reducing costs. However, this technology poses challenges in securing Healthcare-IoT (H-IoT) devices, as low-latency packet transmission increases vulnerability to attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) in 5G networks. 

This research presents a monitoring frequency-based detection and dynamic threshold mitigation method using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) in 5G H-IoT environments. The frequency-based detection method calculates each H-IoT node’s message count over the past five seconds as a percentage of total traffic. Additionally, a dynamic threshold strategy provides adaptive security by averaging detected malicious behavior messages across all nodes to determine the base threshold. This approach enhances classification accuracy and effectively mitigates DDoS attack-affected nodes.

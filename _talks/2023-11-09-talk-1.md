## Description:
The pandemic has demonstrated the need and role of a digitally transformed healthcare system (Healthcare 5.0). The biggest challenge in healthcare IoT (H-IoT) is security, as it connects medical devices, wearables, and infrastructure, enabling real-time monitoring and data sharing. As H-IoT devices transmit massive amounts of healthcare information every millisecond, privacy and security are of utmost importance. The increasing number, scale, and types of cyberattacks on healthcare facilities have demonstrated the urgency for new methods to secure the environment. This talk sheds light on securing H-IoT using AI/ML techniques protecting sensitive/healthcare data and ensuring medical device integrity. It also covers real-time threat and anomaly detection using ML algorithms.
